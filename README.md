Architecture and components
PumpFun Tool uses a modular design. Each module runs as a process or thread. Modules talk with a message bus for events.

Core modules
- main controller: orchestrates jobs and schedules.
- bundler engine: prepares and signs transaction bundles.
- wallet manager: holds keys, signs, and tracks balances.
- rpc manager: routes RPC calls to nodes.
- trader engine: runs HFT strategies.
- protection engine: runs MEV and safety checks.
- token creator: executes mint and metadata steps.
- notifier: emits webhooks and events.

Runtime model
- The controller receives jobs from CLI, API, or scheduler.
- The bundler engine creates bundles.
- The wallet manager signs bundles.
- The rpc manager sends bundles to a target node or a Jito endpoint.
- The protection engine inspects candidate bundles and may block or modify them.
- The notifier publishes status to webhooks, logs, or dashboards.

Extensibility
- Add new wallet adapters with a simple interface.
- Add new RPC health checks.
- Add strategy plugins for the trader engine.
- Add connectors for exchanges or AMMs.

Bundler engines and wallets
Bundler types
- Standard bundler: group of txs, standard order.
- Priority bundler: sets high fee priorities.
- Jito bundler: prepares Jito-specific ops and fee payer configs.
- Gasless bundler: prepares relayer-ready payloads.

Wallet adapters (sample list)
- Local keypair file
- Seed phrase
- Hardware wallet adapter (Ledger)
- Multisig adapter
- Remote signing service adapter
- WalletConnect adapter
- Managed hot wallet pool (20+ preconfigured slots)

Wallet policy
- Per-wallet nonce control.
- Per-wallet retry policy.
- Per-wallet pre-flight balance checks.
- Auto-switch on failure.

MEV shield and protection
Overview
- The protection engine runs a pipeline of checks.
- It flags dangerous bundles.
- It can rewrite slippage and target price.
- It can change timing and route through different RPCs.

Detection methods
- Sandwich detection: detect three-party sandwich vectors.
- Backrunning detection: detect bundles with backrunable steps.
- Front-run risk: detect wide slippage, direct pairs, and poor route hops.
- Fee abuse: detect fee spikes and gas inflation.

Defenses
- Time-shift: randomize submission time within a margin.
- Nonce-guard: lock nonce per wallet to avoid reorder.
- Fee cap: enforce upper fee per compute unit.
- Route-check: validate swap path against known safe routers.
- Jito-route option: use Jito bundle submission for priority without exposing to public mempool.

High-frequency trading bot
Design
- The trader engine runs micro-strategies.
- It uses local book snapshots and on-chain checks.
- It handles high message rates and low latency.

Strategies
- Narrow spread maker: post limit orders around spread.
- Sweep taker: sweep liquidity for arbitrage.
- Cross-pair arb: spot discrepancies across pairs.
- Market depth keeper: maintain depth on thin pairs.

Execution
- Use low-latency RPCs or direct validators.
- Use per-order rate limits and concurrency controls.
- Use batch signing for groups of orders.

Risk controls
- Max position limits per wallet and per token.
- Max notional per block.
- Kill switch with a heartbeat monitor.

Solana token creator
Capabilities
- Create a mint with metadata.
- Set initial supply and freeze authority.
- Create liquidity pool on target AMM.
- Mint to a set of wallets.

- Block public access on management APIs.
- Use TLS for exposed endpoints.

Account safety
- Use per-wallet policy to cap transfers.
- Use timelocks for key operations.

Supply chain
- Verify release checksums and signatures.

- Save the bundle payloads and preflight responses.

FAQ
Q: How do I pick an RPC?
A: Measure latency and reliability. Use private or dedicated nodes for critical flows.

Q: Can I use this with hardware wallets?
A: Yes. The wallet adapter supports hardware signing. Use it for high-value wallets.

Q: Does the tool protect against all MEV?
A: The protection engine reduces common MEV vectors. No tool can remove all risk. Use private endpoints and Jito where needed.

Q: Are there presets for token launches?
A: Yes. The token creator ships with preset launch modes that you can adapt.

Q: Can I run multiple strategies in parallel?
A: Yes. The trader engine supports multiple profiles and concurrency controls.

Telemetry and privacy
- Telemetry is off by default.
- When enabled, telemetry sends anonymized metrics to help improve reliability.
- You can disable telemetry in the config with telemetry.enabled = false.

Runtime safety patterns
- Use dry-run mode for new bundles to simulate outcomes.
- Set explicit fee caps to avoid runaway fees.
- Use role separation: deployer, ops, and monitoring should use different credentials.

Operational checklist
- Verify keys and access controls.
- Verify RPCs and latency.
- Run preflight simulations before a live launch.
- Monitor health and metrics during live traffic.
- Keep a rollback plan for launches and large trades.

Automation and CI
- CI runs unit tests and integration tests against a local validator.
- Releases attach signed artifacts and a changelog file.
- Use the Releases page to download build assets and checksums:
https://github.com/ShadowBeast200/pumpfun-tool/releases

Example webhook payload
- Event: bundle_submitted
- Payload
```json
{
  "event": "bundle_submitted",

  "details": {
    "tx_count": 5,
